				Most of the students in the low developing countries fail to succed in most of their study ares is because we are not only still following the ancient way of education where marks are highly recommended at the final than skills. This makes even the weak person in the class to struggle all of his/her school time fight for good grades forget that people outside there are not only interested in your best grades but also the skill you as aperson. Think about it in this way Bill gates was't among the best students in his class why???? Is it because he is fool???, the truth is nooo, gates knew that the only free time you have is during school times because you are still under the parents care and thats the moment you have to decide yourself.Most of us use that time to impress ourteachers with great marks and constant revisions but for sure thats awaste of precous time which would have been used to enroll in the hands on skill like proggraming especially for acomputer science student
